This skin is not only a customization layer for CSS; it also includes some
templates specific to it. These templates create three new files under
template/en/custom:
  - templatename.html.tmpl, which executes a simple IF
  - templatename_DEFAULT.html.tmpl, which is a symlink back to the
    appropriate default template
  - templatename_XFCE.html.tmpl, which includes all of the Xfce skin changes

Note: There are a few custom templates that are used to override templates
for all themes in the Xfce Bugzilla. These are:
  - index.html.tmpl
  - global/banner.html.tmpl
  - global/header.html.tmpl
  - list/table.html.tmpl

In addition to the CSS files and templates, this skin includes a JavaScript
file, which is included in the global/header.html.tmpl file; please make
sure this is kept included when you modify the header template.
